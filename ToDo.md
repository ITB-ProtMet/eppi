TO DO list
==========
 
 - When a project is open, if I would open a **New** project before EPPI has to close all opened files. **Solution**: I must initialize the opened tabs in somewhere, for example an list, or as class attributes.

 - exit does not work

 - When a Analysis process is rerunned the data inside the tab must be reloaded - see the solution at point 1
